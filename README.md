# Diabetes Drug Recommendation System - Methodology Overview

For educational purposes, I am applying the methodology described in the research paper titled ["Drug Recommendation System for Diabetes Using a Collaborative Filtering and Clustering Approach: Development and Performance Evaluation"](https://www.jmir.org/2022/7/e37233), authored by Luis Fernando Granda Morales, Priscila Valdiviezo-Diaz, Ruth Re√°tegui, and Luis Barba-Guaman.

## Machine Learning Approaches Used

The study employs two key machine learning methods to analyze the data:

- **PCA with Random Forest and GBM**
- **H2O AutoML: Automatic Machine Learning**
- **Random Forest with ShapRFECV Implementation in Python**

## Objective

The primary objective is to:

- Analyze the effects of feature elimination.
- Utilize ShapRFECV for model refinement.
- Identify the most suitable models for the diabetes dataset.

This research serves as a valuable guide to understanding how collaborative filtering and clustering techniques can be effectively applied in drug recommendation systems.
